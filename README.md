# stm32f103c8t6-LCD1602A-drive--java-standard-library-
我写了LCD1602A的驱动,但不知道为什么无法正常显示,字体有乱码,(用的是标准库),请求大佬们指点    (代码在master里) (接线图,现象,手册,都在master中的Wriring diagram and manual)

主要驱动代码在 mokuai里的 MyPCF8574.c/.h 和 MyLCD1602A.c/.h
  部分配置采用寄存器,已经把正常配置的注释了

ENGLISH:
 I wrote the driver for LCD1602A, but I don't know why it can't display normally. There are garbled characters. (I used the standard library.) I'm asking the experts for guidance.
   (The code is in the master branch.) (The wiring diagram, phenomenon, and manual are all in the master.)

The main driving code is located in MyPCF8574.c/.h and MyLCD1602A.c/.h in the mokuai directory.
  Some configurations use registers. The normal configurations have been commented out.
